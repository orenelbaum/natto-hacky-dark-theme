# Natto Hacky Dark Theme

This is a dark theme for [Natto](natto.dev) (an awesome graphical editor for JS). It's pretty hacky, but it's only a temporary solution until Natto adds support for theming.

## How to use

Inisde Natto, import Natto Hacky Dark Theme from npm under the name `natto-hacky-dark-theme`.

In another pane, take the default import, which is a function, and call it. It will apply the theme to the current canvas.
